# Introduction
Sirius Alpha is an IOT module which runs on the ESP32 chips, they are safe and super fast. This module is in it's early stages of development.

Rename .sample.env.yaml as .env.yaml and edit the values

- TLS demo https://github.com/killyourphone/tlsdemo

- You will need to source the setup_envs.sh file before things will work! That sets up the correct compiler overrides for ring's cc based build script.
```shell
source ./scripts/setup_envs.sh
```


```shell
#install node 16 or above
npm -g i nvm

#use node 16 or above
nvm use 16

#install zx globally
npm -g i zx
```

```shell
cd ./scripts
./build.sh
```

- `.env` file will get automatically generated after running the `./build.sh` file
